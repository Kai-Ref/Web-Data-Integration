- (https://query.data.world/s/ixikrqyypwrxygt3rytcqm4x7ctnl2?dws=00000 (added by Jan)) (this data set contains stadiums, capacity, city, country, country population and most importantly, the home club BUT one issue is that club names are often shortened (e.g. Waldhof Mannheim is only "Waldhof", 1.FC Köln is only "Köln"))
